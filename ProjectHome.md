This is a set of functionality written in C# for .NET Framework 4.5.
Originally written with .Net Framework 2.0 and ported over. At the moment not a lot has changed from the jdn2common project.

There's nothing here out of the box that you can use. It's a set of classes that complement .Net 4.5 that help with what you're doing. This is something I've been working on as my personal toolkit and decided to put it out there for everyone to use.
